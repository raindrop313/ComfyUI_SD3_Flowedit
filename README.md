# ComfyUI_SD3_Flowedit
ComfyUI nodes that support SD3/SD3.5 in FlowEdit
# Start
This is an implementation of image editing using [Flowedit](https://github.com/fallenshock/FlowEdit).

It constructs an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) that directly maps between the source and target distributions.

You can use the official pre-trained SD3/SD3.5 models for image mapping. Additionally, you can fine-tune the SD3/SD3.5 models based on your specific needs to learn new distributions for image mapping.

Follow this [workflow](example_workflows/example_SD3_SD3.5_Flowedit.json) to get started.

To use ComfyUI nodes that support Flux in FlowEdit, refer to [ComfyUI-Fluxtapoz](https://github.com/logtd/ComfyUI-Fluxtapoz). This project's source code is based on modifications of ComfyUI-Fluxtapoz.
